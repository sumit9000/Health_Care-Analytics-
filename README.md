# 🏥 Healthcare Analytics Dashboard  
**Built with SQL | Tableau | Power BI | Excel**  
A data-driven analytics solution designed to improve healthcare operations, patient outcomes, and decision-making through actionable insights.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes healthcare data to uncover trends in patient demographics, treatment efficiency, sector performance, and operational challenges. The dashboards and visualizations offer a 360° view of healthcare services — from patient management to operational optimization — across multiple sectors.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **SQL (MySQL)** – Data cleaning, transformation, and KPI calculations  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards for patient care, sector performance, and healthcare trends  
- **Tableau** – Visual storytelling with drill-down features for patient statistics and hospital performance  
- **Excel** – Pivot-based dashboards for quick operational insights and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

- `Healthcare.sql` – SQL scripts for:
  - Patient demographics, treatment patterns, and sector performance  
  - Key healthcare metrics: patient satisfaction, treatment time, and resource utilization  
  - Aggregations by hospital, sector, and service type

- `Healthcare.pptx` – Final presentation deck includes:
  - Introduction to health management  
  - Importance, trends, and challenges in healthcare  
  - Key skills required in the healthcare sector  
  - Final dashboards from Excel, Power BI, and Tableau  
  - Summary and conclusions

## 📊 Dashboards Included

| Tool      | Dashboard Types   | Description |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Excel     | Dashboard 1, 2    | Patient statistics, treatment records, and healthcare sector analysis |
| Tableau   | Dashboard 1, 2    | Patient satisfaction, sector performance, and demographic trends |
| Power BI  | Dashboard 1, 2    | Operational KPIs, patient flow, treatment effectiveness, and resource management |

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Patient Satisfaction** varies significantly across healthcare sectors, highlighting improvement areas  
- **Critical care units** show the longest treatment times, while **outpatient services** have the highest throughput  
- **Preventive care services** are underutilized in several regions despite high population demand  
- Workforce distribution and **resource allocation** directly impact patient outcomes  
- **Operational bottlenecks** identified in emergency care can reduce wait times and improve service delivery

---

## ✅ Use Cases

- **Hospital Management**: Improve patient throughput, reduce treatment times, and optimize resource allocation  
- **Public Health Planning**: Identify underserved sectors and demographic health trends  
- **Quality Improvement**: Track satisfaction scores, treatment delays, and emergency response times  
- **Policy Development**: Use data to support healthcare reforms and funding allocation

---

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

- Normalizing inconsistent patient records and treatment codes  
- Designing visualizations that cater to both strategic policymakers and operational managers  
- Creating advanced calculated fields for KPIs like **utilization rate**, **wait time index**, and **treatment efficiency score**  
- Handling missing demographic and treatment data
